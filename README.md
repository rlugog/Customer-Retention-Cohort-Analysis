# ðŸ“¦ Customer Retention & Cohort Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on evaluating customer retention patterns over time in an online grocery store. By using cohort analysis, we identified behavioral trends across different user groups based on their first purchase month.

## Objectives
- Segment users into monthly cohorts
- Build a retention matrix and retention curves
- Identify trends and churn behavior to improve user retention strategies

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings
- Most user churn occurs after the first month
- Some cohorts showed higher retention, especially those acquired mid-year
- Visualizing retention curves helped identify user segments with better engagement

## Dataset
Simulated online store transaction data including order dates and customer IDs.
